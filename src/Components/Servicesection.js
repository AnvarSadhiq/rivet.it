                Eating a balanced diet helps in managing body weight
                effectively. It promotes the consumption of nutrient-dense foods
                while limiting empty calories from sugary drinks, snacks, and
                processed foods.

                Consuming a variety of foods from different food groups provides
                the body with the energy it needs throughout the day. Balanced
                meals keep blood sugar levels stable and sustain energy levels,
                preventing energy dips and fatigue.
